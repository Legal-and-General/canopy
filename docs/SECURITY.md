# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Canopy is a constantly evolving project, we currently only offer long term support on the mainline branch. Security patches will be fixed forward to this branch and a new version will be deployed. This will require you to update to the latest version and potentially make any required [breaking code changes](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md) as documented in the releases section. If there are extenuating circumstances we may be able to create a patch release, please contact us at canopy@landg.com. We recommended that you stay as up to date as possible with the Canopy releases to reduce friction when upgrading.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have a security concern, please open a draft security advisory where we can discuss what the impact may be and how best to fix it.
