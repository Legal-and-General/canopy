# Filter container

<CustomBadge text="Pending" /> <span class="small-text">Due for brand modernisation</span>

<p class="standfirst">An expanding panel which reveals filter controls, which filter a set of results.</p>

The toggle button is always positioned to the right of the containing element.

## Usage

Import the filter container components in your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgFilterContainerComponent, etc. ],
});
```

and in your HTML:

<Source of={FilterContainerStories.StandardFilterContainer} />

The toggle button **must have** the `lgButtonToggle` directive on it for the component to work properly.

More information on how to use the `lgButtonToggle` directive is available in the [button documentation](./?path=/docs/components-button-guide--docs). Note that there is no need to set the `id` and `ariaControls` properties in this case as they are already handled by the `LgFilterContainerComponent`.
