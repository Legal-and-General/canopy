Provides a generic card component for displaying content. Consists of various card components that are designed to create modular and flexible card layouts, from a basic card with a title, text and buttons to a single-page Form Journey card.

## Usage

For a basic card, import the component in your application:

~~~
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [LgCardModule],
})
~~~

---

### Other card types and templates

You can extend the basic card component and create specific card implementations.

#### Product card

This component uses some extra card components, such as \`LgCardPrincipleDataPoint\` and \`LgCardPrincipleDataPointValue\` to display data points. <a href="#product">View product card implementation</a>.

#### Form Journey card

Creates the Form Journey template, used to display a single page form. Note that the <form> element is a parent of the <lg-card> component, this is because the form inputs and submit button are spread out between the card content and card footer. <a href="#form-journey">View form journey implementation</a>
