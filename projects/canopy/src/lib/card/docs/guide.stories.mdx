# Card

<p class="standfirst">Cards are containers for content and actions on a specific topic.</p>

![example](docs/card/example.png)

## Usage

Cards are a useful way to chunk information into a more easily readable and actionable format. They are used to group content within a page but should not be used as a page substitute.

Import the card module in your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgCardModule ],
});
```

and in your HTML, for a basic card:

```html
<lg-card>
  <lg-card-content>
    {{cardContent}} <a href="#">Test link</a>.
  </lg-card-content>
</lg-card>
```

## How it works

In their most basic form, cards are an empty container for any content. Canopy provides a number of preset card templates and patterns for a range of common scenarios, and we recommend you use those before creating something from scratch.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

![do](docs/card/do.png)

1. **Do** ensure that content relates to a single idea or concept.
2. **Do** summarise content and provide links to expanded content on child pages.
3. **Do** use when each card will contain different types of content.
4. **Do** place directly on the page background.
5. **Do** create layouts that make the hierarchy of the page clearly understood.

### Don't

![dont](docs/card/dont.png)

1. **Don't** overfill, or cover more than one subject within a card.
2. **Don't** use cards as a replacement for standard pages.
3. **Don't** place cards on top of cards.
4. **Don't** use to build complex, cluttered layouts that make the structure difficult to understand.

## Card content and templates

As the card component is just a container for content, you can add whatever content you like. However, you can extend the basic card component and create specific card implementations.

### Product card

This component uses some extra card components, such as `LgCardPrincipleDataPoint`, `LgCardPrincipleDataPointLabel` and `LgCardPrincipleDataPointValue` to display data points.

### Form Journey card

Creates the Form Journey template, used to display a single page form. Note that the `<form>` element is a parent of the `<lg-card>` component, this is because the form inputs and submit button are spread out between the card content and card footer.

### Nested grid

It's possible to nest the Canopy layout grid within a card, as follows:

<Source id="components-card-examples--nested-grid-card"></Source>

### Card Navigation

This component uses some extra card components, such as `LgCardNavigationTitleComponent` to display in navigational format.

## Additional development details

### LgCardComponent

The main body of the card. It accepts the projection of the following components:

- `LgCardHeaderComponent`
- `LgCardContent`
- `LgCardFooter`

### LgCardHeaderComponent

This is the primary layout section of the card component, it is used to contain breadcrumbs or other similar content.

### LgCardContent

This is the secondary layout section of the card component, it is used to contain the cards main content and provides the inner padding of the card.

### LgCardTitleComponent

This is where the main title should be provided. It should be located inside the card content.

#### Inputs

| Name           | Description                                                 | Type     | Default | Required |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| `headingLevel` | The level of the card heading: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` | `number` | n/a     | Yes      |

### LgCardNavigationTitleComponent

This is where the main title and link should be provided. It should be located inside the card content.

#### Inputs

| Name                  | Description                                                            | Type                  | Default | Required |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------|----------|
| `headingLevel`        | The level of the card navigation heading: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` | `number`              | n/a     | Yes      |
| `title`               | The title of the card navigation heading                               | `string`              | `''`    | Yes      |
| `link`                | The link for the card navigation heading                               | `string`              | `''`    | Yes      |
| `queryParams`         | The query params for the **internal** link [^*]                        | `Params`              | `null`  | No       |
| `queryParamsHandling` | The query params handling for the **internal** link [^*]               | `QueryParamsHandling` | `null`  | No       |

[^*]: See Angular documentation for the <a href="https://angular.io/api/router/RouterLink#routerlink" target="_blank">RouterLink</a>.

#### Outputs

| Name               | Description                            | Type                 | Default | Required |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|----------|
| `linkClickedEvent` | Event emitted when the link is clicked | `EventEmitter<void>` | n/a     | No       |

### LgCardSubtitleComponent

If the card has a subtitle it should be located within this component. If a card has a subtitle it is expected to also implicitly have a title. It should be located inside the card content.

### LgCardToggableContent
This is where additional content that can be shown/hidden should be located. This component is part of a pattern and will only work if used together with the `lgButtonToggle` directive.

<Source id="components-card-examples--show-more-card"></Source>

The `isToggleActive` property and `toggleActive` function will be defined in your component as follows:

```ts
isToggleActive: boolean;

toggleActive(state: boolean): void {
  this.isToggleActive = state;
}
```

### LgCardPrincipleDataPoint

Sometimes the card will be displaying a principle data point. In that case this layout component should be used. It should be located inside the card content which will control its layout.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointValue

This is where the value for the data point should be projected. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointLabel

This is where the label for the data point should be projected. A data point should always have a value, but it may not have a label. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointDate

This is where the date for the data point should be projected. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardFooter

This is the footer layout section of the card component, it is used to contain call to action buttons as well as messages or hints.
