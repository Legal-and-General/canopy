# Card

<p class="standfirst">Cards are containers for content and actions on a specific topic.</p>

![example](docs/card/example.png)

## Usage

Cards are a useful way to chunk information into a more easily readable and actionable format. They are used to group content within a page but should not be used as a page substitute.

Import the card module in your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgCardModule ],
});
```

and in your HTML, for a basic card:

```html
<lg-card>
  <lg-card-content>
    {{cardContent}} <a href="#">Test link</a>.
  </lg-card-content>
</lg-card>
```

## How it works

In their most basic form, cards are an empty container for any content. Canopy provides a number of preset card templates and patterns for a range of common scenarios, and we recommend you use those before creating something from scratch.

![layouts](docs/card/layouts.png)

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

![do](docs/card/do.png)

1. **Do** ensure that content relates to a single idea or concept.
2. **Do** summarise content and provide links to expanded content on child pages.
3. **Do** use when each card will contain different types of content.
4. **Do** place directly on the page background.
5. **Do** create layouts that make the hierarchy of the page clearly understood.

### Don't

![dont](docs/card/dont.png)

1. **Don't** overfill, or cover more than one subject within a card.
2. **Don't** use cards as a replacement for standard pages.
3. **Don't** place cards on top of cards.
4. **Don't** use to build complex, cluttered layouts that make the structure difficult to understand.

## Card content and templates

As the card component is just a container for content, you can add whatever content you like. However, you can extend the basic card component and create specific card implementations.

### Product card

This component uses some extra card components, such as `LgCardPrincipleDataPoint`, `LgCardPrincipleDataPointLabel` and `LgCardPrincipleDataPointValue` to display data points.

### Form Journey card

Creates the Form Journey template, used to display a single page form. Note that the `<form>` element is a parent of the `<lg-card>` component, this is because the form inputs and submit button are spread out between the card content and card footer.

### Nested grid

It's possible to nest the Canopy layout grid within a card, as follows:

<Source id="components-card-examples--nested-grid-card"></Source>

### Card Navigation

This component uses some extra card components, such as `LgCardNavigationTitleComponent` to display in navigational format.

<Source id="components-card-examples--navigation-card"></Source>

### Card with Data Points

This component uses some extra card components, such as `LgCardContentInnerDataPoints` to display the correct layout of data points.

## Additional development details

### LgCardComponent

The main body of the card. It accepts the projection of the following components:

- `LgCardHeaderComponent`
- `LgCardContent`
- `LgCardFooter`

#### Inputs
The orientation input arranges the direct children of the card in vertical or horizontal layout, a responsive way.
It accepts an object, where the **key** is a mobile-first breakpoint from the standard list of available breakpoints: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`.
The value is from the set of available Orientation options.
The current available options for Orientation are `vertical`, `horizontal`, `reverse-vertical`, `reverse-horizontal`.

| Name           | Description                                                     | Type                    | Default | Required |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|----------|
|   `variant`    | The variant of the card: `promotion`                            | `string`                |`default`|  No      |
| `orientation`  | The orientation of the card content: `{ sm: 'vertical' }`       | `OrientationResponsive` |   n/a   |  No      |

### Responsive examples of orientations

Let's say that at the `sm` breakpoint you want to apply `vertical` orientation, then at the `md` breakpoint apply `horizontal` orientation, then at the `lg` breakpoint apply `vertical` orientation.
The object you'd pass into `orientation` would look like this:

```html

<lg-card [orientation]="{ sm: 'vertical', md: 'horizontal', lg: 'vertical' }"></lg-card>

```

### LgCardHeroImageComponent

This is the primary layout section of the card component, it is used to contain a hero Image or a Brand Icon.
An image is added via either the `coverImageUrl` input, or 'imageSrc' input(see below for differences). A Brand Icon is added via content projection using the `<lg-brand-icon>` component.

#### Displaying a background cover image
To display an image as the background image of this element, which fills the container at a set height or width using `background-size: cover`, simply provide a URL to the desired image to the `coverImageUrl` input.

Note that this image will fill the space of the container, but will preserve it's own aspect ratio, and therefore will be cropped in various ways. For example, on a tablet breakpoint, the container has a portrait aspect ratio, and then on desktop, it is landscape. Therefore we recommend that you only use images that are a large square, with the focus of the image in the centre (like a face), to avoid anything important being cut off.

``
<lg-card-hero-img [coverImageUrl]="imageUrl">
</lg-card-hero-img>
``

#### Displaying a normal image tag
To display an image, simply provide a URL to the desired image to the `imageSrc` input. Using this method will set the image to the
full width and height of the container, so you will need to choose the image size carefully to fit for purpose. We recomand a image with aspect ratio of
3:2, dimensions: 600 Ã— 400. You can also give an image alt text using the `imageAlt` input, and if the `imageAlt` input is not defined it will default
to 'card-hero-img' as alt text for the image.

``
<lg-card-hero-img [imageSrc]="imageUrl">
</lg-card-hero-img>
``

#### Displaying a Brand Icon
To use this component with a Brand Icon, the following is needed:

Import the brand icon module in your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgBrandIconModule ],
});
```

Import the `LgBrandIconRegistry` service and register your brand icons inside your module:

```js
// import the desired icon
import { lgBrandIconSun } from '@legal-and-general/canopy';


export class SomeModule {
  constructor(private brandIconRegistry: LgBrandIconRegistry) {
    // register the icon using the `brandIconRegistry` service
    this.brandIconRegistry.registerBrandIcon([
      lgBrandIconSun
    ]);
  }
}
```

and in the HTML
```html
<lg-card-hero-img>
  <lg-brand-icon [name]="iconName" size="xs"></lg-brand-icon>
</lg-card-hero-img>
```

#### Inputs

| Name           | Description                                                                             | Type     | Default          | Required |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|----------|
|`coverImageUrl` | The image url to be displayed as a background cover image: `/testUrl`                   | `string` | n/a              | No       |
|   `imageSrc`   | The image url to be displayed as an image tag: `/testUrl`                               | `string` | n/a              | No       |
|   `imageAlt`   | The alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed: `card-hero-img`      | `string` | `card-hero-img`  | No       |

### LgCardHeaderComponent

This is the primary layout section of the card component, it is used to contain breadcrumbs or other similar content.

### LgCardContent

This is the secondary layout section of the card component, it is used to contain the cards main content and provides the inner padding of the card.

### LgCardContentInnerDataPoints

This is the tertiary layout section of the card component, it is used to specifically contain data points components and provides their layout styles.

### LgCardTitleComponent

This is where the main title should be provided. It should be located inside the card content.

#### Inputs

| Name           | Description                                                 | Type     | Default | Required |

| `linkClickedEvent` | Event emitted when the link is clicked | `EventEmitter<void>` | n/a     | No       |

### LgCardSubtitleComponent

If the card has a subtitle it should be located within this component. If a card has a subtitle it is expected to also implicitly have a title. It should be located inside the card content.

### LgCardToggableContent
This is where additional content that can be shown/hidden should be located. This component is part of a pattern and will only work if used together with the `lgButtonToggle` directive.

<Source id="components-card-examples--show-more-card"></Source>

The `isToggleActive` property and `toggleActive` function will be defined in your component as follows:

```ts
isToggleActive: boolean;

toggleActive(state: boolean): void {
  this.isToggleActive = state;
}
```

### LgCardPrincipleDataPoint

Sometimes the card will be displaying a principle data point. In that case this layout component should be used. It should be located inside the card content which will control its layout.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointValue

This is where the value for the data point should be projected. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointLabel

This is where the label for the data point should be projected. A data point should always have a value, but it may not have a label. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointDate

This is where the date for the data point should be projected. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardFooter

This is the footer layout section of the card component, it is used to contain call to action buttons as well as messages or hints.
