# Card

<p class="standfirst">Cards are containers for content and actions on a specific topic.</p>

![example](docs/card/example.png)

## Usage

Cards are a useful way to chunk information into a more easily readable and actionable format. They are used to group content within a page but should not be used as a page substitute.

Import the card components in your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgCardComponent, etc. ],
});
```

and in your HTML, for a basic card:

```html
<lg-card>
  <lg-card-content>
    {{cardContent}} <a href="#">Test link</a>.
  </lg-card-content>
</lg-card>
```

## How it works

In their most basic form, cards are an empty container for any content. Canopy provides a number of preset card templates and patterns for a range of common scenarios, and we recommend you use those before creating something from scratch.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

![do](docs/card/do.png)

1. **Do** ensure that content relates to a single idea or concept.
2. **Do** summarise content and provide links to expanded content on child pages.
3. **Do** use when each card will contain different types of content.
4. **Do** place directly on the page background.
5. **Do** create layouts that make the hierarchy of the page clearly understood.

### Don't

![dont](docs/card/dont.png)

1. **Don't** overfill, or cover more than one subject within a card.
2. **Don't** use cards as a replacement for standard pages.
3. **Don't** place cards on top of cards.
4. **Don't** use to build complex, cluttered layouts that make the structure difficult to understand.

## Card content and templates

As the card component is just a container for content, you can add whatever content you like. However, you can extend the basic card component and create specific card implementations.

### Product card

This component uses some extra card components, such as `LgCardPrincipleDataPoint`, `LgCardPrincipleDataPointLabel` and `LgCardPrincipleDataPointValue` to display data points.

### Form Journey card

Creates the Form Journey template, used to display a single page form. Note that the `<form>` element is a parent of the `<lg-card>` component, this is because the form inputs and submit button are spread out between the card content and card footer.

### Card Navigation

This component uses some extra card components, such as `LgCardNavigationTitleComponent` to display in navigational format.

<Source id="components-card-examples--navigation-card"></Source>

### Card with Data Points

This component uses some extra card components, such as `LgCardContentInnerDataPoints` to display the correct layout of data points.

<Source id="components-card-examples--data-points-card"></Source>

### Card Group

Cards can be grouped together by using the `LgCardGroupComponent` - a container to group together two or more cards so that they are organised correctly throughout the different breakpoints and have the same height.

The card group should always be wrapped in a `lgCol="12"` container as shown in the example below.

### LgCardHeaderComponent

This is the primary layout section of the card component, it is used to contain breadcrumbs or other similar content.

### LgCardContent

This is the secondary layout section of the card component, it is used to contain the cards main content and provides the inner padding of the card.

### LgCardContentInnerDataPoints

This is the tertiary layout section of the card component, it is used to specifically contain data points components and provides their layout styles.

### LgCardTitleComponent

This is where the main title should be provided. It should be located inside the card content.

#### Inputs

| Name           | Description                                                 | Type     | Default | Required |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| `headingLevel` | The level of the card heading: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` | `number` | n/a     | Yes      |

### LgCardNavigationTitleComponent

This is where the main title and link should be provided. It should be located inside the card content.

#### Inputs

| Name                  | Description                                                            | Type                  | Default | Required |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------|----------|
| `headingLevel`        | The level of the card navigation heading: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` | `number`              | n/a     | Yes      |
| `title`               | The title of the card navigation heading                               | `string`              | `''`    | Yes      |
| `link`                | The link for the card navigation heading                               | `string`              | `''`    | Yes      |
| `queryParams`         | The query params for the **internal** link [^*]                        | `Params`              | `null`  | No       |

#### Outputs

| Name               | Description                            | Type                 | Default | Required |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|----------|
| `linkClickedEvent` | Event emitted when the link is clicked | `EventEmitter<void>` | n/a     | No       |

### LgCardSubtitleComponent

If the card has a subtitle it should be located within this component. If a card has a subtitle it is expected to also implicitly have a title. It should be located inside the card content.

### LgCardSubheadingComponent

This is where the card subheading should be provided. It should be located inside the card content.

#### Inputs

| Name           | Description                                                    | Type     | Default | Required |

**Note: The subheading styling will be consistent across all heading levels**

### LgCardToggableContent
This is where additional content that can be shown/hidden should be located. This component is part of a pattern and will only work if used together with the `lgButtonToggle` directive.

<Source id="components-card-examples--show-more-card"></Source>

The `isToggleActive` property and `toggleActive` function will be defined in your component as follows:

```ts
isToggleActive: boolean;

toggleActive(state: boolean): void {
  this.isToggleActive = state;
}
```

### LgCardPrincipleDataPoint

Sometimes the card will be displaying a principle data point. In that case this layout component should be used. It should be located inside the card content which will control its layout.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointValue

This is where the value for the data point should be projected. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointLabel

This is where the label for the data point should be projected. A data point should always have a value, but it may not have a label. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardPrincipleDataPointDate

This is where the date for the data point should be projected. It should be located inside the card principle data point.

### LgCardFooter

This is the footer layout section of the card component, it is used to contain call to action buttons as well as messages or hints.
