# Hero Component


## Purpose
A flexible component that is often used to display the most prominent information about a page. The module consists of lots of smaller presentation components that help to map out the common hero use cases.

### LgHeroComponent
This is the branded bar which runs across
the top of the page. It also controls the functionality to create the 'overlap' between the page content.

#### Configure Overlap

~~~html
<lg-hero [overlap]="2"></lg-hero>
~~~

#### Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| \`\`overlap\`\` | The amount that the page content overlaps the hero component (rem) | number | 2 | No |


### LgHeroContent
This is the main section of the hero bar, it stretches the full width and is agnostic of grid system. You will need to configure the grid in the contents of this component to match your page layout.

#### Configure Grid

~~~html
<lg-hero [overlap]="2">
  <lg-hero-content>
    <div lgContainer>
      <div lgRow>
        <div lgCol="12">
          <lg-hero-card>
            ...
          </lg-hero-card>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </lg-hero-content>
</lg-hero>
~~~

### LgHeroContent
This is the top section of the hero bar, it stretches the full width and is agnostic of grid system. It is generally used to home the breadcrumb component if there is one. Similar to LgHeroContent you will need to configure the grid in the contents of this component to match your page layout.

### LgHeroCard
A container component for displaying content within the hero area. The hero and hero card components are agnostic of the grid layout of the page. You will need to wrap the hero card component with the specific grid that is required.

### LgHeroCardHeaderComponent
This is the primary layout section of the hero component, it is used to contain the title, subtitle and principle value.

### LgHeroCardTitleComponent
