## Other hero types and templates

You can extend the basic Hero component and create specific Hero layouts and implementations.

### Hero with breadcrumbs

Using the \`\`LgHeroCardHeaderComponent\`\` together with \`\`LgBreadcrumbComponent\`\`, some breadcrumbs can be easily added to the hero. Note that you should use the "light" variant of the Breadcrumbs, as it's rendering against a dark blue background.

~~~html
<lg-hero [overlap]="overlap">
  <lg-hero-header>
    <div lgContainer>
      <div lgRow>
        <div [lgCol]="12">
          <lg-breadcrumb lgMarginBottom="none">
            <lg-breadcrumb-item>
              <a href="#"><lg-icon [name]="'home'"></lg-icon>Home</a>
            </lg-breadcrumb-item>
            <lg-breadcrumb-item>
              <a href="#" aria-current="page">Product Details</a>
            </lg-breadcrumb-item>
          </lg-breadcrumb>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </lg-hero-header>
</lg-hero>
~~~

### Product details

This component can used to display product data, for example on a prodcut details page. Note the extensive use of presentation components to acheive the desired layout.

~~~html

  <lg-hero-content>
    <div lgContainer>
