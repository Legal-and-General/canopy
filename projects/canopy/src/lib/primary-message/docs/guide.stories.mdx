# Primary message

<p class="standfirst">A message that sits in the page and provides a simple and engaging message to the user.</p>

![example](docs/primary-message/example.png)

## Usage

A primary message should contain key information, while not requiring full and immediate attention. It can be used in the following contexts:

| State       | Use when                            | Example                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Empty       | No items to show                    | You have no transactions                    |
| Error       | Something is erroneous              | Cannot find the page you are looking for    |
| Information | Additional information is available | New feature intro guide                     |
| Success     | An action was completed             | All done! Completion of application journey |



Import the primary message component into your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgPrimaryMessageComponent ],
});
```



and in your HTML:

<Source id="components-primary-message-examples--standard-primary-message"></Source>



## How it works

A primary message should be the only content that displays in a container.

- It contains a brand icon that can be tinted. Choose an appropriate brand icon from the [brand icon catalogue](./?path=/story/foundations-brand-icon-catalog--standard-brand-icons), and choose an appropriate tint according to the scenario. For instance, a success state brand icon might be tinted with `--color-lily-green`. Read the [brand icon guide](./?path=/docs/foundations-brand-icon-guide--docs) for more details.
- It contains a title and description. [Read our writing page](./?path=/docs/principles-writing--docs) for how to write appropriate copy.
- (Optional) It can contain a button. When using a primary message at the end of a journey, adding a button is a great way to guide the user to the next step so they don't get stuck in a dead-end.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

![do](docs/primary-message/do.png)

1. **Do** use when there is no other functionality or content.
2. **Do** use when space is not limited.
3. **Do** use an appropriate brand icon to capture the message you want to convey.
4. **Do** recolour the tint according to status.

### Don't

![dont](docs/primary-message/dont.png)

1. **Don't** use on a page where it's not the only content, e.g. a form.
2. **Don't** use for validation. Use form validation instead.
