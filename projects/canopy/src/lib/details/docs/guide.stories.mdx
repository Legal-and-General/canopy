# Details

<p class="standfirst">The Details component reduces page clutter and cognitive load by letting users reveal more information as and when they need it.</p>

![Details component example](docs/details/example.png)

## Usage

Use the details component to hide secondary information like FAQs and supporting details to make pages easier to scan.

Import the details module into your module:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgDetailsModule ],
})
```

and in your HTML:

<Source id="components-details-examples--standard-details"></Source>

Information that is important or relevant to most users should not be included within this component and should be displayed on the page instead.

The component has NOT been designed for large amounts of information or rich content (sound, video, etc). It should only be used for small amounts of content. It can be used to contain Link components or simple imagery, if required.

The Details component can also be styled to match the [Inline Message component](./?path=/docs/components-inline-message-alert-guide--page) with `warning`, `info`, `success` and `error` colouring. This lets you highlight information in different ways depending on severity. In the above example, we've used the Info variation to highlight a message telling the user they triggered a Money Purchase Annual Allowance.

**These colours should be used sparingly; the generic variation should suitable for most situations.**

## How it works

The details component combines an icon, label and chevron within a container. Clicking anywhere within the container will expand or collapse the content within. Content should be collapsed by default.

The "alert" ARIA role is automatically added to the component if it's one of these variants: `warning`, `error`, `success`. Note that this role will tell the browser to send out an accessible alert event to assistive technology products which can then notify the user about it.

A decorative icon is also added next to the heading if it's one of the these variants: `info`, `warning`, `error`, `success`.

## Research on this pattern

This component is based on best practice and has not had specific usability testing.

More research to be conducted into whether the error state should be deprecated, as the details component may not be a suitable for errors.

If you need to hide large amounts of content, the [Accordion component](./?path=/docs/components-accordion-guide--page) may be more suitable.
