# Spinner

<p class="standfirst">A spinner lets the user know that something is happening. They are normally used on form submissions or loading pages when the data retrieval is typically slow.</p>

![example](docs/spinner/example.png)

## Usage

This component should be used in instances where the duration of a process can't be determined.

Import the spinner module in your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgSpinnerModule ],
});
```

and in your HTML:

<Source id="components-spinner-examples--standard-alert"></Source>

The spinner component should always be used together with the `LgSrAlertMessageDirective` as screen reader users should be notified when something has finished loading.

## How it works

The spinner animates until the process is completed, when it is replaced by content or the user is navigated to the next part of the journey.

When a spinner is used by itself on a page or card, it must always be accompanied by a supporting message. This message should briefly explain the reason for the wait.

A spinner used inside a component such as a button or input doesn't need an accompanying message.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

![do](docs/spinner/do.png)

1. **Do** use spinners to help manage user expectations against technical limitations.

### Don't

![dont](docs/spinner/dont.png)

1. **Don't** use a spinner if the duration of the process can be pre-determined.
2. **Don't** use multiple spinners in a single view.

### Inputs

| Name      | Description                        |                          Type                          |   Default   | Required |
|-----------|------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| `variant` | The spinner variant                | `SpinnerVariant` (`dark`, `light`, `color`, `inherit`) |   `dark`    |    No    |
| `size`    | The size of the spinner            |               `SpinnerSize` (`xs`, `sm`, `md`)               |    `md`     |    No    |
| `text`    | The text to show under the spinner |                        `string`                        | `undefined` |    No    |

If the `variant` is set to `inherit`, then it will inherit the font colour of its parent element. This is used on the loading button, where the spinner inherits the font colour of the button.

## Research on this component

The spinner is based on best practice but has not had research or testing.
