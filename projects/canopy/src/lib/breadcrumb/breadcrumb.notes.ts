export const notes = `
Displays the path of the user's journey from top-level through to child. 

Note that there is different behavior on mobile vs desktop: 

* Desktop: The top-level (root), current and previous levels of hierarchy are displayed.
* Mobile: Only one crumb is displayed, which takes the user back to the previous level.

## Usage

Import the component in your module:

~~~js
@NgModule({
  ...
  declarations: [ ..., LgBreadcrumbModule ],
})
~~~

### Displaying more than 3 items

If there are more than 3 levels of hierarchy, a collapsed breadcrumb should be used on desktop. This is achieved by using \`LgBreadcrumbItemEllipsisComponent\` (see full example below). 

~~~html
<lg-breadcrumb-item-ellipsis></lg-breadcrumb-item-ellipsis>
~~~

*This is not automatically added and should be implemented in your app.*
