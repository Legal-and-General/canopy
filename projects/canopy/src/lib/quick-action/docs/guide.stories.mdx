# Quick action

<p class="standfirst">Quick actions are small buttons that can be used to provide functionality in context, such as editing a form or actions on a card.</p>

![example](docs/quick-action/example.png)

## Usage

Quick actions should be used to increase the affordance of a specific function when a primary CTA would be too prominent. They are typically used to give access to functionality in the context of a piece of content or data. An example would be when allowing the user to change their bank details in the context of showing them bank details:

Quick actions shouldn't be used to complete form journeys or to invite the user to read more. In these scenarios, a button or link should be used.

Import the quick action component into your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgQuickActionComponent ],
});
```

Use in your HTML as a button:

```html
<button lg-quick-action>
  <lg-icon [name]="icon"></lg-icon>
  Load more
</button>
```

or alternatively as a link:

```html
<a lg-quick-action [href]="link" [target]="target">
  <lg-icon [name]="icon"></lg-icon>
  Send us a message
</a>
```

## How it works

Comprising an icon and accompanying text label, the Quick Action describes a specific task available.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

![do](docs/quick-action/do.png)

1. **Do** use to indicate / highlight / spotlight functionality available.
2. **Do** use concise labels that are descriptive and help set the user's expectations.

### Don't

![dont](docs/quick-action/dont.png)

1. **Don't** use in place of buttons or links.
2. **Don't** use too many quick actions, we suggest a maximum of three.
3. **Don't** use overly wordy labels. Like buttons, quick action labels do not wrap and therefore microcopy needs to be less than the width of the container.
