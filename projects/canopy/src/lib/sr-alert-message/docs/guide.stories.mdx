# Screen reader alert message

This directive allows for temporary visually hidden alert messages to be read out by screen readers. For example when something has finished loading.

## Usage

Import the screen reader alert message directive in your application:

```js
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [ ..., LgSrAlertMessageDirective ],
});
```

In your HTML, apply the directive to the relevant element.

Pass in a boolean value to indicate when the message should be read out. When `true` the message will be read by the screen reader and will be removed after a set period (default is 8000ms).

This directive can be used together with the `LgSpinnerComponent` to show a spinner while something is loading and then send a message to screen readers when it has finished loading.

```html
# Display a spinner while loading
<lg-spinner *ngIf="!loaded"></lg-spinner>

# Tell the screen reader to read a message when loading is finished
<p [lgSrAlertMessage]="loaded">Loading complete</p>
```
