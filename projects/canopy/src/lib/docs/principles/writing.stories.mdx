# Writing

<p class="standfirst">Here's an extract from our tone of voice guidelines, which can be found in full on the <a href="https://www.legalandgeneralbrandhub.com/b/www/c/en-GB/BrandKnowledge/Guideline/2?Page=205" target="_blank">L&G Brand Hub</a>.</p>

## Bright, Calm and Real

Our purpose is to improve the lives of our customers, build a better society for the long term and create value for our shareholders.

To achieve this, we must be clear and consistent in the way we communicate. That's why we've created these guidelines. They're for anyone who has to write for Legal and General, whether that's for an internal or external audience.

## Brand Personality

The following encapsulate our new personality in 3 actionable traits.They will guide all visual, verbal and experiential executions for the brand.

### Bright

We bring intelligence, energy, belief and colour to the greyer bits of life. Being bright is about having fresh, relevant ideas – expressed in fresh ways. People value us for our expertise so we should demonstrate our knowledge, insight and understanding.

### Calm

We keep it simple and thoughtful. No rushing in, or standing out when we don't need to. We keep it simple and concise, with a quiet confidence that lets the facts speak for themselves.

### Real

We are loyal. Wholehearted and precise. So the shape of our answers fits the shape of real life. Even though we do amazing things for people, we're down to earth and sound warm - like our customers. Whoever we're writing for we're always clear and transparent.

## Content Principles

### Lead with the benefit
What's in it for the audience? Make it clear early on.

### Understand the audience

Explain acronyms and avoid jargon.

### Active not passive
'The government increased corporation tax' is better than "Corporation tax has been increased".

### Draw pictures with words
Objects are easier to grasp than abstract ideas.

### Structure your thoughts
Decide the order of messages that best makes your case.

### Edit and simplify
Cut out any unnecessary words. Beware of long sentences.

### You vs. We
Rephrase with "you" replacing "we" as it involves the audience more.

### Get emotional
Financial services change lives so let's reveal how.

### Write like you speak
Avoid clichés and use contractions like "You're" rather than "You are".

## Our Approach

When we create content our goal is to meet the needs of our users. We aim to give them the information they are there for in the easiest most accessible way. To help us write great content here is the approach we adopt as a team.


### 1. Focus on the needs of the customer

#### Empathise with customers

Imagine how our customers are feeling when they arrive on the page of journey. Maybe they've just had some life-changing news, they're confused about some policy information or frustrated that they can't figure out how to do something.

Customers' needs differ depending on their task at hand. Great content should empathise with those needs.

- Customers trying to update their address might want quick and actionable direction that's short to the point with a clear link to how to do it.
- Customers trying to find out if they are covered for a critical illness might need content which is more informative, whilst being empathetic and offering additional reassurance.

#### Be clear on the customer's goal
Before you start writing, define how your content will help our customers. This will help you stay on topic and only include genuinely useful advice.

### 2. Make it easy to understand

#### Use the words that customers use

Instead of using complex vocabulary or official terms that customers aren't familiar with, try to write with words customer would use. The average adult in the UK has a reading age of 9 years old. So the easier the article is to understand the more chance it has of deflecting a phone call. It's important to consider the age of the customer and their level of technical knowledge.

**Try not to use internal jargon whenever possible.**

- **Write like you speak.** Think of the words you would choose when explaining a complex idea to a friend. Say things like, "You can", "It's best to", and "This feature is great for..."
- **Be confident.** Use active language instead of the passive voice and choose strong words like "you should", "you need to" and "we recommend." The more confident your tone, the more your customers will believe in your advice.
- **Have fun.** If you feel positive while writing, this will shine through in your article, which will motivate our customers to learn and progress. Keep your tone upbeat and positive.

**Article titles** - This should set customers' expectations for what the article contains, and how it can help. Keep this short and to the point, like "How do I update my address online"

**Link text** - Writing link text that says "click here" or "find out more" isn't helpful. If you need to link to a feature or page use words customers are likely to use. e.g. "Update my address" or "View my policy documents"

### 3. Make it easy to read

#### Keep it scannable

Keep each paragraph short and to the point so you don't overwhelm your customers with too much information. Research shows that people don't read big blocks of text, instead they scan a page. Breaking information into bite-sized chunks can help customers to cover a lot of information at a glance.

#### Good formatting helps the reader

When reading, customers' attention will be naturally drawn to your article description and subheadings - so use these to call out your most important points. Adding bullet-points, screenshots and plenty of whitespaces also makes it easy for customers to quickly scan your article and find what they need.

#### Where possible use more than words

Where necessary include images, diagrams or even video that can help customers resolve their issue without having to read a lot.

## Error messaging

### Be clear and not ambiguous

Being explicitly clear and precise helps to avoid confusion, especially as it's likely the user would be frustrated.

### Be succinct and meaningful

The messaging should be to the point and relevant to the users context, needs and actions.

### Be proximate and timely

Consider the placement and location of the message so that the user can easily know where the error occurred.

### Be actionable and helpful

Give clear actionable direction on how to resolve or recover from the problem. We should always reduce the users effort by "doing the heavy lifting" wherever possible.

### Be nice and human

Use a friendly voice without blaming the user and avoid technical jargon.

## Summary

Above all our content should help customers get what they need first and foremost. So keep your writing to the point, accessible, empowering and friendly.

Good luck and happy writing!
