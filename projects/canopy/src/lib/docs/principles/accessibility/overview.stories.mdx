# Overview

> "The power of the Web is in its universality.
> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."
>
> <cite>Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web</cite>

## Introduction

Before diving into explaining some of the key aspects of web accessibility here are some interesting facts to make you understand how important it is to create websites that are accessible by any user no matter their disabilities:

- there are around 14.6 million disable people in the UK (almost one in five of the population).
- only 17% of disabled people were born with their disabilities. The majority of disabled people acquire their disability later in life.
- for an average business, disabled people may account for up to 20% of all costumers. Many businesses fail to recognise the business opportunity that improved access presents.
- the main reasons for disabled customers switching to a more accessible competitor include inaccessible websites.

## What is Web accessibility?

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

Web accessibility isn’t just a moral requirement but also a legal one:

> [...] website owners have been obliged by law to ensure that their websites are accessible to all users, as it is illegal to treat those with disabilities less favourably.
>
> <cite>Equality Act of 2010</cite>

In order to achieve this we have to start thinking and learning about how other users use our websites and applications; in what circumstances do they use it.

### Common challenges that we have to think about

Accessibility means more than just making a website work for people with visual impairment or installing a ramp to enable wheel chair access. There are many types of impairments that can be permanent, temporary or even situational. Here are some different examples:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Permanent</th>
      <th>Temporary</th>
      <th>Situational</th>

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Intoxicated</li>
          <li>Non native speaker</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Getting started

These guidelines are based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>.
There are 3 levels of conformance to the guidelines, A, AA, and AAA with AAA conformance being the highest possible level that can be achieved.

For reasons of practicality and to allow more design freedom, we have chosen to base our guidelines on AA conformance, which provides excellent accessibility and has minimal impact on design.

By following these guidelines we can ensure that our goal of at least WCAG AA compliance is met along with some important AAA conformance criteria.

## Designing for accessibility *

To design for accessibility means to **be inclusive to the needs of your users**.
