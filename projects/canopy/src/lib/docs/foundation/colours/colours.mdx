# Colours

<p class="standfirst">We are a bright and colourful brand, and don't shy away from it. Our palette draws its colours from our umbrella, and defines our core colours.</p>

## Usage

Import the css into the `angular.json` file of your application:

```json
"styles": [
  "node_modules/@legal-and-general/canopy/canopy.css"
],
```

## Accessibility

It's important we use colours that provide an accessible experience to every user.

This means that all colour combinations must adhere to WCAG 2.0 level AA standards, and have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. We recommend using <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">Colour Contrast Checker</a>, but there are many similar tools available.

Normal text is defined as 16px regular, while Large text is defined as 18.66px if bold or 24px regular.

Custom gradients should not be used anywhere in your project.
