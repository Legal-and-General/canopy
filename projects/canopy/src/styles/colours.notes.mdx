# Colours

We are a bright and colourful brand, and don’t shy away from it. Our palette draws its colours from our umbrella, and defines our core colours.

## Accessibility

It's important the we use colours that provide an accessible experience to every user.

This means that all colour combinations must adhere to WCAG 2.0 level AA standards, and have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. We recommend using [Colour Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), but there are many similar tools available.

Normal text is defined as 16px regular, while Large text is defined as 18.66px if bold or 24px regular.

Custom gradients should not be used anywhere in your project.

## Core

Colour is an integral part of our identity and toolkit. We are a bright and colourful brand, and don’t shy away from it. Our palette draws its colours from our umbrella, and defines our core colours.

Our designs will always use at least one of the core colours as the foundation for an application’s colour palette.

Primary colours are used for:

- Key actions such as primary call to action buttons
- Highlighted content
- Form field elements

## Secondary

The rest of our colour palette expands on the four core colours. We use complementary lighter and darker colours to create variation and definition, particularly in:

- Data visualisation
- Illustration
- Infographics
- Brand icons
