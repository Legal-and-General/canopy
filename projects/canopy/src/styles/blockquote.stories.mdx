# Blockquote

<p class="standfirst">A blockquote is used to denote text that has come from another source.</p>

<div class="lg-sb-preview">
  <Story id="components-blockquote-examples--quote"></Story>
</div>

## Usage

The [blockquote](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) and [cite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite) styles are part of the Canopy global stylesheet, therefore using the HTML below should be enough:

```html
<blockquote>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
  <cite>The author</cite>
</blockquote>
```

In addition to that, the side line's colour can be changed by overriding the `--blockquote-border-left-colour` css variable.
