# Link

<p class="standfirst">Links are used in content to navigate to other resources, pages or views.</p>

![example](docs/link/example.png)

## Usage

Links should be used within text content only.

The links styles are applied automatically when adding the global Canopy css.

## How it works

The user taps or clicks a link to navigate to a new page.

- If the page it links to is internal (i.e. hosted by the same organisation on the same domain), it should open in the same tab;

- If the page it links to is external (hosted by a different organisation on a different domain), it should open in a new tab.

For accessibility, links that open in a new tab must be accompanied by an external link icon and text so that the user understands that a new tab will open when they interact with it:

![external](docs/link/external.png)

```html
<a href="#" target="_blank">
  Read more about accessibility
  <lg-icon name="link-external"></lg-icon>
  <span class="lg-visually-hidden">opens in a new tab</span>
</a>
```



Links are blue in most cases, except when they're used in inline messages where they conform to the colour of the paragraph text in the message. For instance, a success message will have dark green paragraph text and links will also be dark green.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

![do](docs/link/do.png)

1. **Do** write links as meaningful phrases
2. **Do** use accompanying icons as appropriate, such as for files
3. **Do** consider grouping links at the end of content
4. **Do** use an icon to indicate links to external websites

### Don't

![dont](docs/link/dont.png)

1. **Don't** use a link for a specific primary action; Use a quick action or button instead
2. **Don't** use single words or unclear phrases, such as "click here"
3. **Don't** split links across several lines where possible
4. **Don't** use more than 4-5 words

## Additional development details

For accessibility reasons, the link's context should always be clear.


For example a link with text "Read more" doesn't give enough information to a screen reader user about what the link's context is. Hidden text can be added like so:

```html
<a href="#">Read more<span class="lg-visually-hidden"> about accessibility</span></a>
```



For custom components it's possible to override the style of a link by using the `lg-unstyled-link` [scss mixin](.?path=/docs/helpers-style-mixins--page).
