# Link

<p class="standfirst">A Link is an interactive text element that enables users to navigate from one resource, page, or view to another—either within the application or to external destinations—in a way that is accessible to all users.</p>

![example](docs/link/example.png)

## Usage

Links must be used for navigation interactions—enabling users to move between resources, pages, or views, both within the application and to external destinations. Links can be used anywhere navigation is required.

### Basic usage

Use the standard HTML anchor (`<a>`) element. Canopy's global CSS will automatically apply the correct styles.

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

### Links with icons

Links may include any icon from the Canopy icon library to provide additional context (such as file type or navigation direction). The icon must sit before the link text.

```html
<a href="#" target="_blank">
  <lg-icon name="pdf"></lg-icon>
  This is a link with a pdf icon
</a>
```

### External links

External links must use the external link icon, which always sits after the link text. For accessibility, include visually hidden text to indicate the link opens in a new tab.

```html
<a href="#" target="_blank">
  Read more about accessibility
  <lg-icon name="link-external"></lg-icon>
  <span class="lg-visually-hidden">opens in a new tab</span>
</a>
```

### Placement

* Links can be placed within the body of text to provide inline navigation.

* For forward navigation or to prevent dead ends, group links at the end of content or sections where appropriate.

### Guidance

* Use links only for navigation. For actions (such as submitting forms or triggering UI changes), use a Button instead.

* Every link must use clear, descriptive text that communicates its destination or purpose as concisely as possible, without sacrificing meaning.

* There are no restrictions on where links can be used, as long as they serve a navigational purpose.

## How it works

The user taps or clicks a link to navigate to a new page.

* Internal links (same organisation/domain) open in the same tab.

* External links (different organisation/domain) open in a new tab.

### Colour modes

Links automatically inherit the appropriate colour based on their parent’s colour theme.

* By default, links are blue.

* When conveying status (such as in success or error messages), links are monochrome.

* On bold backgrounds, links are white for blue, green, and red backgrounds, and black for yellow backgrounds.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

![do](docs/link/do.png)

1. **Do** use links for navigation—if the element takes the user to a new page, view, or resource, aim to use a link, not a button.
2. **Do** write links as concise, meaningful phrases that describe their destination or purpose.
3. **Do** use icons to provide additional context when appropriate (for example, file type or external links).
4. **Do** group related links at the end of content or sections where it helps users navigate.
5. **Do** use the external link icon and visually hidden text for links that open in a new tab.

### Don't

![dont](docs/link/dont.png)

1. **Don't** use links for primary actions—use a button or quick action instead.
2. **Don't** use vague or generic phrases like “click here” or “read more” without context.
3. **Don't** use unnecessarily long or wordy link text—keep it concise without sacrificing clarity.

## Additional development details

For accessibility reasons, the link's context should always be clear.

For example a link with text "Read more" doesn't give enough information to a screen reader user about what the link's context is. Hidden text can be added like so:

```html
<a href="#">Read more<span class="lg-visually-hidden"> about accessibility</span></a>
```

For custom components it's possible to override the style of a link by using the `lg-unstyled-link` [scss mixin](./?path=/docs/helpers-style-mixins--docs).
