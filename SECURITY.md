# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Canopy is a constantly evolving project, we currently only offer long term support on the mainline branch. Security patches will be fixed forward to this branch and a new version will be deployed. This will require you to update to the latest version and potentially make any required breaking code changes as documented in the releases section. If there are extenuating circumstances we may be able to create a patch release, please contact us at canopy@landg.com. We recommended that you stay as up to date as possible with the Canopy releases to reduce friction when upgrading.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have a security concern, please open a draft security advisory where we can discuss what the impact may be and how best to fix it.
